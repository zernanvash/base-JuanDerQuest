# Base-JuanDerQuest
JuanDerQuest is an eco-tourism platform designed to help address Pangasinan’s tourism challenges including overcrowding, waste buildup, and poor site maintenance, while also helping people discover beautiful hidden locations. It invites everyone to help take care of the environment through “Eco Quests”, which are fun activities such as cleanup drives, trivia challenges, and tree planting. Upon participation, users also earn JDQ Tokens and NFT badges as verifiable proof of their impact. These tokens can be redeemed in local shops, donated for the maintenance of the tourist spots, or staked to vote in community decisions, like which tourist destination to feature next. By giving travelers the power to actively protect nature and have a say in local tourism, JuanDerQuest uses blockchain technology to create an open and rewarding system that helps our environment, supports local businesses, and shows a better way to travel.
